##Solution
###1st bug: 
Replace the "." with "\\."
###2nd bug:
Change the 2 in the switch so that it includes the third option too. 
###3rd bug:
Add break statements so that it does not go to the last one after starting, so if it starts on the first it repeats until it is on the last. 
###4th bug:
Change the '' for "" because if not it is attempting to create a character and it doesn't work.
